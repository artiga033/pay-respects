## How to Pay Respects

Please follow the instruction for your shell:

<details>
	<summary>Bash / Zsh / Fish</summary>

> Auto aliasing (optional custom alias can be added after `--alias`):
> ```shell
> eval "$(pay-respects bash --alias)"
> eval "$(pay-respects zsh --alias)"
> pay-respects fish --alias | source
> ```
> Additional arguments:
> - `--nocnf`: Disables `command_not_found` handler

> Manual aliasing (**deprecated**, do not use):
> ```shell
> alias f="$(pay-respects bash)"
> alias f="$(pay-respects zsh)"
> alias f="$(pay-respects fish)"
> ```

</details>

<details>
	<summary>Nushell</summary>

> Add the following output to your configuration file:
> ```shell
> pay-respects nushell [--alias <alias>]
> ```

> Or save it as a file:
> ```shell
> pay-respects nushell [--alias <alias>] | save -f ~/.pay-respects.nu
> ```
> and source from your config file:
> ```shell
> source ~/.pay-respects.nu
> ```

</details>

<details>
	<summary>PowerShell</summary>

> Append the following to your profile:
> ```pwsh
> pay-respects pwsh [--alias <alias>] [--nocnf] [>> $PROFILE] # use the pipe to directly append it to your profile if you like
> ```

</details>

<details>
	<summary>Custom initialization for arbitrary shell</summary>

> pay-respects only requires 2 environment variables to function:
>
> - `_PR_SHELL`: The binary name of the current working shell.
> - `_PR_LAST_COMMAND`: The last command.
>
> pay-respects echos back, if applicable, a `cd` command that can be evaluated by the current working shell.

> General example:
> ```shell
> eval $(_PR_SHELL=sh _PR_LAST_COMMAND="git comit" pay-respects)
> ```

</details>

You can now **press `F` to Pay Respects**!

## Installing

Install from your package manager if available:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pay-respects.svg)](https://repology.org/project/pay-respects/versions)

For Arch Linux / Arch Linux ARM users, you can install from [Arch Linux CN Repository](https://github.com/archlinuxcn/repo):

Or install compiled binaries from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/iffse/pay-respects/releases) with the install script:
```
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iffse/pay-respects/main/install.sh | sh
```

<details>
	<summary>Compile from source (any OS/architecture)</summary>

> This installation requires you to have Cargo (the Rust package manager) installed.

> Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/), features are optional
> ```shell
> cargo install pay-respects --all-features
> ```

> Clone from git and install, suitable for adding custom compile-time rules:
> ```
> git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/iffse/pay-respects

> cargo install --path .
> ```

> Features:
>
> - `runtime-rules`: Read rules in runtime
> - `request-ai`: Request AI for suggestion
> - `libcurl`: Dynamically link `libcurl` for requests, which requires openssl at compile time
> 	- Only matters to package maintainers, as by turning it off gives fewer headaches when cross-compiling
